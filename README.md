# Example of a XML data provider to Occtoo
The program reads the file books.xml and converts each book element into a Dynamic Entity. They are then imported into Occtoo using the [OnboardingServiceClient](https://github.com/Occtoo/Occtoo.Onboarding.Sdk)


Check our documentation on [how to set up a Provider in Occtoo Studio](https://docs.occtoo.com/docs/get-started/provide-data#12-create-data-provider) to get your provider details.
